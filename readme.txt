LOG

This is a GRAPHQL back end test server, using express graphQL

The final product is deployed at a backend and all logics are correct

Please note that this Graphql is only at the SDL stage, note that there

Still needs to be a 

type Query {
  # Define your queries here
}

type Mutation {
  # Define your mutations here
}

type Subscription {
  # Define your subscriptions here
}

For this to be complete.

Please deploy the final_schema.graphql
