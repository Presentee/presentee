##  Guide to collaboration
[Here](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67) is a guide and best practices for collaboration for everyone to work together.

## Unit Testing
There is a tests folder in the src folder that has tests that would be nice to be expended.

## Comments
There should probably be a standard to how comments should be written. From the experience of commenting on complex web applications as this project grows we all should be able to understand them. Meaningful comments with explainations and examples would probably be nice for this application since it has a backend.

## Cloud Server
This application is fully run on AWS Amplify. The authenication is being done by cognito. The backend API is being done in GraphQL, more learning about this might be needed.
