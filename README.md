# Important updates to React version 18
[Please read here](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html).


## Unit Testing
There is a tests folder in the client src folder that has tests that would be nice to be expended.

## Comments
There should probably be a standard to how comments should be written. From the experience of commenting on complex web applications as this project grows we all should be able to understand them. Meaningful comments with explainations and examples would probably be nice for this application since it has a backend.

## Cloud Server
There are plans to move the database to AWS, probably still using mongodb. This has not been fully implemented so some changes to the database configuration might be necessary until we can get the database server fully implemented.
